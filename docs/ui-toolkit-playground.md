# UI Toolkit playground

The playground is a development tool for experimenting with toolkit components inside Minecraft.

## Opening the playground

- Start the client through `runClient` and press **F7**.
- Press **F8** to open the `ItemSlot` example screen, with `InventoryGrid` and JEI drag integration. The shortcut is configurable in Controls.
- Use **Theme** in the top toolbar to choose **Dark** or **Light**; this changes the global theme while the playground is open.
- The key can be changed under **Options → Controls → R-Ui Lib**.
- In development runs, **F6** displays the test toast sequence over the game. This key can also be changed in Controls.
- The screen is registered only in development runs. It is not available in production installations of the mod.
- **Toast** cycles through the four notification levels. Notifications in the upper-right corner disappear after four seconds; left-click a notification to dismiss it.
- **Table** provides sample rows, selection, and vertical scrolling. In the inspector, edit the comma-separated headers and the number of columns.
- **ProgressBar** displays determinate progress. In the inspector, configure the range as `minimum, maximum, value` and switch between displaying the value and the normalized percentage. Values are rounded to integers; the percentage ranges from `0%` to `100%`, regardless of the range. The API supports height, track/fill colors, a formatter, and percentage mode. In Preview, the example continuously moves from minimum to maximum and back; returning to Edit restores the configured value.
- **RadialMenu** starts with four segments. In the inspector, edit the comma-separated labels; in Preview, press, drag to a sector, and release to trigger the demonstration action. The center area cancels the selection.
- **Dialog** opens a demonstration `Modal`. It is centered over the screen, contains focus and input, closes with Escape or its internal button, and also accepts outside clicks when enabled.

## Building a layout

- Drag a type from the palette on the left onto the canvas. It contains `Label`, `Button`, `IconButton`, `Panel`, `Card`, `Divider`, `Toggle`, `Chip`, `TextField`, `SearchField`, `Slider`, `ProgressBar`, `RadialMenu`, `ItemCard`, `ItemSlot`, `Tabs`, `ScrollView`, `ClipStack`, `Row`, `Column`, `Stack`, `Grid`, `ItemGrid`, `Table`, `Spacer`, and `AbsoluteLayout`. The list scrolls with the mouse wheel in short windows. `ItemRenderer` is a helper used by `ItemCard` and `ItemSlot`, not a separate node.
- `Panel` and `Card` accept children; nest a `Row`, `Column`, or `Grid` to define the inner layout. `Card` also exposes a selected state in the inspector. `IconButton` uses the first character of its name as its icon and shows the name in a themed tooltip. Item tooltips continue to use the vanilla renderer. `Divider` is horizontal in the playground.
- Select a node to edit its text, color, position, dimensions, spacing, and alignment in the inspector; press **Apply** to apply the fields. Drag the lower-right corner to resize; **Delete** or **Remove** deletes the node.
- Drop a component onto `Row`, `Column`, or `Stack` to nest it. The container then controls its children's positions; X/Y become inactive, while width and height remain adjustable.
- Drop `ItemCard` onto `Grid` or `ItemGrid` to build a grid. The inspector edits the grid's columns and spacing, and the card's namespaced item ID and count. `Spacer` can be fixed (adjust Width/Height) or flexible (the Flex button in the inspector), filling the remaining space in `Row`/`Column`.
- `ItemSlot` accepts items dragged from JEI when JEI is installed. The selected item is a filter reference and does not enter an inventory; right-click, Delete, or Backspace clears the slot. In the F8 example screen, the player grid lets you click or drag items into slots without removing them from the inventory.
- Drag a child onto an empty area of the canvas to move it back into `AbsoluteLayout`.

## Testing and saving

- Switch between **Preview** and **Edit** in the top toolbar. In Preview, the palette and inspector disappear and the canvas fills the available width; the top toolbar remains accessible for returning to Edit or closing. Drag with the middle mouse button in **Edit** and **Preview** to pan the canvas; this does not change saved positions, and the pan is preserved when switching modes. Buttons, toggles, and chips respond to the mouse, Tab/Shift+Tab, Enter, and Space. `Tabs` changes pages by clicking or using the left/right arrows while focused. Interactions update the visible status/counter.
- Drop children inside `Tabs` to create pages; the first child's text serves as the tab title. Add two or more pages to navigate between them.
- Text fields support editing in Preview; `TextField` and `SearchField` retain the value saved in the layout. The search field displays a magnifying glass, and both vertically center their text with at least 8 px of left padding. `ScrollView` stacks children vertically, scrolls with the mouse wheel, and supports dragging its scrollbar. `ClipStack` overlays its children and clips any drawing outside the container.
- `Slider` can be adjusted by dragging, scrolling, or using the keyboard. In the inspector, edit the range as `minimum, maximum, step`; use a step of `0` for continuous values. `Value` sets the initial value; fill in `Upper` to enable the second handle or leave it empty to use a single handle. For example, use the range `0, 1000, 1`, a `Value` of `10`, and an `Upper` of `100`. The second handle always remains above the first. Clicking or scrolling adjusts the handle closest to the mouse; while focused, Space switches handles, and arrows, Home/End, and Page Up/Down adjust the selected handle. Both values are saved in JSON.
- `ProgressBar` is visual only and displays the current value rounded without decimal places; its values can be edited as `minimum, maximum, value`. Use the `Format` button in the inspector to display the normalized percentage from `0%` to `100%`. In Preview, the value demonstrates the continuous progress cycle.
- Enter a name in the top text box and use **Save** to write to `config/r_ui_lib/ui-playground/` inside the game directory. **Load** always lists the bundled `Basic`, `Input`, `Layout`, `Data`, `Status`, and `Scroll` reference layouts, followed by saved layouts; select an entry and confirm. The bundled examples load directly from the mod and are available even before any layout has been saved.
- When the playground opens, the last saved layout loads automatically. If older layouts have no record of the last save, the most recently modified JSON file is used.
- **New** creates an empty document. Demonstration callbacks are recreated locally and are never written to JSON.
- File or format errors appear in the screen's bottom bar.

Documents use `version: 1`; the playground rejects unknown versions and structurally invalid layouts without closing the game.
